            MISSION is the End Point. Without a clearly defined Mission and
            Vision the Plans can go in any direction and the management does not
            have a clear road ahead of them. Mission and Vision are there to
            define the strategic direction of the organization. Mission
            statement should answer the question that Why do we exist?
            Ultimately every organization is created by the owners to create
            wealth for them but this cannot be the organization goal. How this
            wealth would be created would be the mission statement. The mission
            statement should be the guiding principle for every employee of the
            organization. The mission statement answers the basic questions of
            why your company exists and describes the needs your company was
            created to fulfill.
